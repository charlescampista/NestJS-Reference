# Charles Payever Task


The project was implented the best way I could, I haven't used NestJS and RBTMQ Before please take it into account. I've faced a hard time trying to make environment variables visible to the system, if it doesn't work it is Possible to test the project adding the string directly. all the endpoits required were implemented. I haven't written unit test due to lack of time.

Whatever is the result! Thanks for the oportunity!

You can check out the way I code better on my [GitHub](https://github.com/charlescampista)


## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run the project, you must have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:


- Open a terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.
- Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

- Once the dependencies have been installed, build the project by running the following command:
```
npm run build
```


This will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and generate a `dist` directory that contains the compiled JavaScript files.

- Finally, start the server by running the following command:

```
npm run start
```


This will start your server and listen for incoming requests on the default port (which is usually `3000`).
